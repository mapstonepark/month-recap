# Keep track of your life
A template that will help you breakdown what you did each month. Check in on your physical, mental and social health and get a better feel for how you spent your time.

## Currently working on making sure that recaplist underneath form displays better with correct sections. 

Look and see if there are any images that bootstrap has that would work well for each section.
Then we can add the other form elements to recap the month properly

No glyph icons that I prefer so will replace with just descriptors for recap section. Look into icons using other tools in the future if we want to jazz it up.
